# code runner

a little game based on those interaction-bait tiktoks/reels where you have to solve for a code from the hints given - retro arcade theme!!

## demo

to demo, you can [click here!!](https://code-runner-game.vercel.app/)

## how to play

- through the process of elimination, you have to crack the code using the hints provided on the left.
- if you guess incorrectly, you will lose half a heart. this will continue until you lose all your hearts, signaling game over.
- each level has a randomized code, and the high score is your highest level achieved.

## controls

- use left and right arrow keys to move between the digits.
- use backspace to delete the currently focused digit.
- press enter to guess.

## notes

- this game is best played on pc!
- pssttt, if you don't want to solve the code, there's a console log of the code that you can enter ;)
- the hints are generated from the code through an algorithm that allows you to crack it, but the algorithm isn't perfect. expect an unsolvable code every once in a while (and dm me on slack if you find one :)).

## coming soon
- timer (toggle in settings).

## usage of ai - ai has been used in the creation of this project, specifically chatgpt.

- ai has been used in helping me with errors i came across in the hint generation algorithm.
- ai has been useed in the written text for the guide.
