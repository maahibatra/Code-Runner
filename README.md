# Code Runner

A little game based on those interaction-bait tiktoks/reels where you have to solve for a code from the hints given - Retro Arcade Theme!!

## Demo

To demo, you can [Click here!!](https://code-runner-pied.vercel.app/)

## How To Play

- Through the process of elimination, you have to crack the code using the hints provided on the left.
- If you guess incorrectly, you will lose half a heart. This will continue until you lose all your hearts, signaling game over.
- Each level has a randomized code, and the high score is your highest level achieved.

## Controls

- Use left and right arrow keys to move between the digits.
- Use backspace to delete the currently focused digit.
- Press Enter to guess.

## Notes

- This game is best played on PC!
- Pssttt, if you don't want to solve the code, there's a console log of the code that you can enter ;)
- The hints are generated from the code through an algorithm that allows you to crack it, but the algorithm isn't perfect. Expect an unsolvable code every once in a while (and DM me on Slack if you find one :)).
